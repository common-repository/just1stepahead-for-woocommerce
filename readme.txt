== Important ==

1 This PlugIn relies on a third party, Just1StepAhead, as a service to send text messages.
2 A degree of personal data about you will be held by Just1StepAhead.
3 Link to third party site site: [https://www.just1stepahead.com/](https://www.just1stepahead.com/).

5 Just1StepAhead SMS Notifications requires WooCommerce 3.0.0 or higher, WordPress 3.1 or higher, and PHP 5.3 or higher.
6 Yes, like every other free-to-install WooCommerce SMS PlugIn you'll need to buy mobile phone credits from third party Just1StepAhead up front - but ours are really inexpensive.  For example, 100 texts cost 3.75p each(Â£3.75/100 + VAT).   Buy 1,000 and they'll be 3.5p each.  The more you buy at any one time the less they cost.  However, we give you ten free credits to start you off, so there's no need to buy any right away when you activate our PlugIn.  Bear in mind if you ask any sms plugin to send you every last scrap of info on an order, you could run over 160 characters and they will have to deduct two credits.  But you can select which WooCommerce fields your website will send you by sms at setup stage.

English only for now...

== Technical Support ==

Our system is deliberately designed to be simple and user-friendly.  All the same, we offer technical support through the Just1StepAhead website, with real people based in the UK. 

== Donations ==

We would not even have the nerve to ask you for donations for a PlugIn selling you SMS credits.  All we ask, if you like our PlugIn, is that you leave positive reviews and five stars.
